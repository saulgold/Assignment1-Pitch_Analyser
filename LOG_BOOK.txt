-created project "Assignment1".
-used code from timerdelay to test blinking LED - worked.\
-added function initialise to include all initialisation code. - failed getting local vairable error so reverted 
-added ADChannelDrv header and source file to attempt to read audio from the mic
-added PWMChannelDrv head and source files
-added releent code to read and write audi oto the mic and speaker respectively - works
-tried reading the AudioIn variable to see what form the input was, but wouldn't work. after some fiddleing it did work.
	but all values were 0. Reasons for this were to do with ping pong ing between the buffers or something.

-today I will try and implement FFT on the audio in.
-copy pasted FFT code and set AudioIn to signcmp.real, builds and runs fine.
-now trying to output FFT to csv using fopen, needed to increase heap size, so increased it to 1000 bytes arbitrarily.
